# Disaster_Message_Classification
Using Naive Bayes Model to classify messages to check whether it is related to any disaster that happened anywhere around the world. Used different messages related to the same from Twitter to train the model.

Classifying twitter news into disaster related and not disaster related using both Standard Vector Model and Naive Bayes Model. Vectorization of contents are done. This helped in reducing the time taken for training and predicting. Naive model had less accuracy when compared with SVM model. 

Naive model without vectorization in previous project with same dataset produced better accuracy than naive bayes with vectorization done in this project. However accuracy of SVM model is better than both of these.
